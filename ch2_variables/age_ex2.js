/* Faster solution: 
let age = 20;
console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 10} years old.`);
console.log(`In 20 years, you will be ${age + 20} years old.`);
console.log(`In 30 years, you will be ${age + 30} years old.`);
console.log(`In 40 years, you will be ${age + 40} years old.`);
